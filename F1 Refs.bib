  abstract = "Any engineering structure, irrespective of its intended purpose,
              must be made of one or more materials. More often than not it is
              the choice and behaviour of those materials that determine its
              mechanical performance. The introduction of fibre reinforced
              composite chassis was one of the most significant developments in
              the history of Grand Prix motor racing. Technological advances
              gained from these advanced materials have produced cars that are
              lighter, faster and safer than ever before. The manufacture of
              Formula 1 cars is now dominated by composites. A short
              introduction to the science of composite materials will be
              followed by a history of their use and development within the
              sport. Design manufacture and operation of composite structures
              are reviewed. Reference is also made to their energy absorbing
              properties that have contributed so significantly to the improved
              safety record of Formula 1 and the more specialist composite
              materials, such as carbon--carbon, used in brakes and clutches.",

               Study of Competition in Formula 1 Racing",

  abstract  = "This paper explores the trajectories of three key technologies
               in Formula 1 racing at the component, firm and system levels of
               analysis. The purpose is to gain an understanding of the
               evolutionary forces that contribute to the emergence and
               survival of dominant designs. Based on archival data and
               contemporaneous accounts of the period 1967-1982, we develop a
               series of propositions specifying the evolutionary forces acting
               on technological trajectories within each level of analysis. The
               resulting framework leads to a set of predictions about
               relationships between technological transparency, co-evolution,
               and the emergence of dominant designs. Specifically, we argue
               that when the costs and difficulty associated with transferring
               component knowledge between firms is low (technological
               transparency is high), technologies tend to co-evolve across
               firms, leading to the development of complementary technologies
               and increasing the likelihood of industry dominance. Where
               transparency is low, however, technologies tend to co-evolve
               across functions within firms, leading to the development of
               competing technologies across firms, increasing the likelihood
               of a technology's dominance within the firm. The data and
               argument suggest that the forces acting on these two types of
               technological trajectories are self-reinforcing, so that as
               momentum builds behind a trajectory, it becomes more likely that
               its evolutionary path will end in either firm-or system-level
               dominance.",
